## Two Number Sum
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an
integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum
up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any
order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
an empty array.

Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers
in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the
target sum.

You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to
the target sum.

## Validate Sequence
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
instance, the numbers <span>[1, 3, 4]</span>  form a subsequence of the array
<span>[1, 2, 3, 4]</span>, and so do the numbers <span>[2, 4]</span>. Note
that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
subsequences of the array.

## Sorted Squared Array
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted
in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares
of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
